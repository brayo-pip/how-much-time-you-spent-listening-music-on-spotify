# How Much Time You Spent On Listening Spotify ?
Honestly i was wondering this question for sometime and finally decided to make a python script to answer this question. There are easier ways of learning your listening time like downloading an app on your phone but i just wanted to make my own version.

In this readme file i will be teaching you how to get your data from Spotify and learn your listening time.
## How to get your listening data from Spotify?
1. To get your data go to this adress https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/

2. Request your data by following the steps under 'Download your data' headline.

## How to calculate your total listening time?
1. Download your data by going to your mailbox and finding the mail from Spotify that contains your data.

2. Open the file and go to 'MyData' and select every file that starts with 'StreamingHistory' and put them in the folder named 'your-data' in the folder of script. You can also put every file in there too but this looks better

3. Open the script, after running the script, it will print a line that contains your listening time data.
